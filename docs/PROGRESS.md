# Progress log

Running, dated log of what happened and what's next. This is the primary continuity
mechanism between sessions (see `AGENTS.md`) — write entries assuming the next reader
(agent or human) has zero memory of this session.

Newest entries at the top. One entry per session/sitting.

Set up harness engineering scaffolding for solo, direct-to-`main` development, adapted from
Anthropic's long-running agent harness posts and OpenAI's "Harness engineering" post.

- Added `AGENTS.md` (repo map), `README.md`, `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes` tuned for Altium.
- Added `docs/` structure: `design-docs/`, `exec-plans/` (active/completed/tracker/template),
  `product-specs/`, `references/`, `hardware/` (BOM tracking, revision history, verification
  checklist).
- No hardware/product content authored yet — this session was scaffolding only. Repo still
  only contains `RheoBoard_V8_Final/` (Altium project, imported as-is, no revision history
  captured prior to this point).

**Next:** fill in `docs/product-specs/index.md` with the actual RheoBoard/RheoMap/SlipTopo
context once available, and backfill `docs/hardware/revision-history.md` for the existing
V8 board if worth reconstructing.
