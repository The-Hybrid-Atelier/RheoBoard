# Progress log

Running, dated log of what happened and what's next. This is the primary continuity
mechanism between sessions (see `AGENTS.md`) — write entries assuming the next reader
(agent or human) has zero memory of this session.

Newest entries at the top. One entry per session/sitting.

Fleshed out `BuildYourOwn/` into an Instructables-style tutorial structure, per direction that
the deliverable is a full step-by-step guide (BOM, laser-cut platform files, pictographic
circuit diagrams, assembly video) rather than a single flat assembly doc.

- Added `BuildYourOwn/laser-cut/` — scaffold + conventions for platform design files (vector
  source of truth, DXF for cutting, material/thickness/kerf notes to add once known).
- Updated `BuildYourOwn/wiring/README.md` to recommend pictographic/breadboard-style diagrams
  (e.g. Fritzing) over pure schematics, per explicit request.
- Replaced the flat `BuildYourOwn/ASSEMBLY.md` with `BuildYourOwn/tutorial/`: a
  `README.md` table-of-contents/intro, a `steps/` folder (one subfolder per numbered step, each
  with its own `README.md` + `media/`), and a `_step-template/` to copy when adding a step.
  Decided videos should generally be linked externally (e.g. unlisted YouTube) rather than
  committed to git, to avoid repo bloat — documented in `tutorial/README.md`.
- Updated `BuildYourOwn/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
  `docs/hardware/build-your-own/verification-checklist.md` to match.
- Still all empty/TBD scaffolding — no BOM entries, design files, diagrams, or step content
  written yet.

**Next:** pick the first real step to write (probably "gather materials" or "cut the platform")
once parts/design decisions start landing — likely worth an exec-plan for the first pass at the
whole tutorial rather than trickling steps in ad hoc.

Learned there are two hardware tracks, not one, and restructured the repo accordingly:

- **Build Your Own (BYO)** — off-the-shelf modules/dev boards, breadboard/perfboard, wiring
  diagrams + BOM + assembly guide instead of CAD. **This is the current focus going forward.**
- **PCB** — the existing Altium project (`RheoBoard_V8_Final/`). Not actively worked on now.

Changes:
- Added `BuildYourOwn/` at repo root (`README.md`, `BOM.md`, `ASSEMBLY.md`, `wiring/`) — all
  empty/TBD scaffolding, nothing built yet.
- Split `docs/hardware/` into `docs/hardware/pcb/` (moved the existing BOM-tracking,
  revision-history, verification-checklist docs here unchanged) and
  `docs/hardware/build-your-own/` (new equivalents, adapted for a no-CAD DIY build — e.g. no
  DRC/ERC, continuity/power-up checks instead). Added `docs/hardware/index.md` as the map
  between the two.
- Updated `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/product-specs/index.md` to describe both tracks and
  flag BYO as current focus.
- Did **not** touch `RheoBoard_V8_Final/` itself — left it exactly where it is to avoid any
  risk of breaking internal Altium project references.

**Next:** start populating `BuildYourOwn/BOM.md` once parts are chosen — probably worth opening
an exec-plan for the first BYO revision rather than editing ad hoc.

## 2026-07-07

Set up harness engineering scaffolding for solo, direct-to-`main` development, adapted from
Anthropic's long-running agent harness posts and OpenAI's "Harness engineering" post.

- Added `AGENTS.md` (repo map), `README.md`, `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes` tuned for Altium.
- Added `docs/` structure: `design-docs/`, `exec-plans/` (active/completed/tracker/template),
  `product-specs/`, `references/`, `hardware/` (BOM tracking, revision history, verification
  checklist).
- No hardware/product content authored yet — this session was scaffolding only. Repo still
  only contains `RheoBoard_V8_Final/` (Altium project, imported as-is, no revision history
  captured prior to this point).

**Next:** fill in `docs/product-specs/index.md` with the actual RheoBoard/RheoMap/SlipTopo
context once available, and backfill `docs/hardware/revision-history.md` for the existing
V8 board if worth reconstructing.
